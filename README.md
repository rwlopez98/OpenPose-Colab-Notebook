# OpenPose-Colab-Notebook
OpenPose Colab Notebook (Working January 15th. 2025) Includes JSON to MatLab Export

Thank you to @https://github.com/14790897 for doing a lot of the ground work for me back in August 2023.

This is a rebuild notebook version of OpenPose designed to be run and excuted on Google Colab.
I've gone ahead and rehosted all the missing files on my own personal Google Drive and this project
links to those locations. I plan on leaving them up for the timebeing. I updated this project mainly to
leverage a lot of the newer functions of Colab to improve performance and increase robustness of the
project as more versions of dependant software come out.

I can't garuntee how long this will be working for, but will probably be a good launching point for anyone looking
to do a OpenPose project.

This is a GPU levereged Linux/Ubuntu based build of OpenPose which also includes the JSON -> MatLab export functionality.

Feel free to reach out to me at my email raylo123wxyz@gmail.com with questions related to this project or if it seems
like the links are broken.
